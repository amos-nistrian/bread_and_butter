TREES
	Binary Search Tree
		- tree is build from array, order of the array builds different looking trees
		- left child is smaller than root right child is greater or equal to root
		- show worst case: tree is built from a sorted array (sorted array)-> [7, 8, 13, 14, 21]
			access
			search O(n)
			insert 
			delete
		- show average case 
			access
			search  O(lg(n))
			insert 
			delete 
		- Space complexity at worst for both cases is O(n)
	
	
	Min Heap
		-root is smallest
		-the parent of a node must be smaller than the values of all its children
		-siblings have no relation.

	Max Heap  
		-root is greatest
		-the parent always have greater value compared to all its children. 

		One common implementation of heap is Binary heap where each parent can have at most two children.

	AVL Tree or Height Balanced Tree 
		It is a variation of the Binary tree where height difference between left and right sub tree can be at most 1. If at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property. Lookup, insertion, and deletion all take O(log n) time in both the average and worst cases, where n is the number of nodes in the tree prior to the operation.

	Splay Tree
		A splay tree is a self-adjusting binary search tree with the additional property that recently accessed elements are quick to access again. All normal operations on a binary search tree are combined with one basic operation, called splaying. Splaying the tree for a certain element rearranges the tree so that the element is placed at the root of the tree.

SEARCHES TREES AND GRAPHS
	Binary Search
		- Very effiecient when data is in sorted order (binary search tree)
	Depth-First-Search & Breadth-First-Search
		Traverse order
			pre: root,L,R
			in-order: L,root,R
			post-order: L,R,root
		Advantages & Disadvanteges of each search
		(https://www.kirupa.com/developer/actionscript/depth_breadth_search7.htm)
	Breadth-First-Search
		- use when tree is wide (img example)(https://www.kirupa.com/developer/actionscript/images/exampleGraphTut.gif)
	Depth-First-Search
		- use when tree is taller than it is wide (img example)(https://www.kirupa.com/developer/actionscript/images/exampleGraphTut.gif)
	When to use each
	

SORTS
	Quick Sort (java uses in Arrays.sort())
		(Move everything to )
		Quick sort picks a random element from the dataset as the pivot element, then sorts all elements smaller before that and all greater than the pivot after it.
		Then quicksort is executed on the part left of the pivot and right of it.
		- In place
		- Not stable
		- O(n) space complexity

		-Stable
		-Space complexity O(n), Good Explanation: https://www.quora.com/Algorithms-How-does-merge-sort-have-space-complexity-O-n-for-worst-case
